   - **Source Folder**: Choose the folder containing your photos to organize
   - **Destination Folder**: Choose where you want the organized folders to be created

3. **Configure Settings**
   - **Face Recognition Tolerance**: Adjust similarity threshold (lower = more strict matching)
   - **GPU Acceleration**: Enable if you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU setup
   - **Max Threads**: Configure parallel processing (default: CPU cores, max: 16)
   - **Resize Factor**: Adjust image resizing for speed vs. accuracy (0.25-1.0)

4. **Start Organization**
   - Click "Start Organization" to begin the process
   - **NEW**: Use "Stop Processing" to halt operation at any time
   - The tool will scan all images and detect faces using parallel processing
   - You'll be prompted to name each unique face detected
   - Photos will be automatically organized into person-specific folders

### Advanced Features
- **Cache Management**: Use "Clear Cache" to reset face encodings if you want to reprocess images
- **Tolerance Tuning**: Lower values (0.3-0.5) for stricter matching, higher values (0.6-0.8) for more lenient matching
- **GPU Acceleration**: Significantly faster processing for large image collections
- **Performance Tuning**: Adjust thread count and resize factor based on your system capabilities
