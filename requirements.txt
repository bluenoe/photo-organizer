# Photo Manager Dependencies
# Core image processing library (optional but recommended)
Pillow>=9.0.0

# Face recognition dependencies (optional but required for face-based organization)
face_recognition>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0

# Note: face_recognition requires dlib which may need additional setup:
# - On Windows: Install Visual Studio Build Tools or use pre-compiled wheels
# - On macOS: Install cmake (brew install cmake)
# - On Linux: Install cmake and build-essential

# Note: tkinter comes built-in with Python
# Other standard libraries used: os, shutil, hashlib, datetime, collections, re, pathlib
# The application will work without Pillow but with limited functionality (no image preview or EXIF data)
